# Exploration of the FBI NICS dataset
This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

### Project Status
Completed

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to acquire skills in data wrangling, data cleaning and exploratory data analysis

## Project Description
In order to explore the possibility of influence of some socioeconomic parameters on gun sales in the US I used the FBI NICS dataset and a US census data set. Despite the fact that US citizens seem to see owing guns as their innate right there seem to be differences in using this right throughout the US. In order to better understand which socioeconomic factors might be associated with this varying behaviour I will explore some questions related to gun sales like which variables from the uS census data are correlated to gun sales, the trend of gun sales between 2010 and 2016, the states with the highest and lowest gun sales and the association of females, foreign born persons, house owners, wealth and education with gun sales.

 # Finding Donors
This project is part of the Udacity Machine Learning Introduction Nanodegree program.

### Project Status
Completed

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to practice skills in data wrangling and supervised machine learning.

## Project Description
In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. I first explored the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, I applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. I then evaluated several supervised learning techniques of my choice on the data, and considered which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, I optimized the selected model and presented it as my solution to CharityML. Finally, you will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.(Text taken from Udacity)
